# Fuzzy-Logic-for-Camera-Inference


It is almost impossible to make errors while focusing due to the high technical quality of
cameras, owing to the automatic control systems developed in digital cameras.

● Today’s cameras include the latest innovations that ensure that the focal length, white
balance, exposure and focusing is not compromised.

●The exposure control system of a camera is determined by the combination of three elements:
Aperture, Shutter Speed and Sensitivity of Sensor.

● Today’s Exposure systems use fuzzy logic and light measuring to get the luminance of the
image, and make histograms to decide the best exposure.

● Our aim is to show how a system works under incident light conditions and to show
the relation between aperture, speed and sensitivity.
